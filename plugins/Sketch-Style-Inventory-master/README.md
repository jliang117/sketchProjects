# Style Inventory for Sketch

Design requires free, sometimes chaotic exploration. But design also means organization and structure. Sketch can be good in both aspects, but moving from exploration to structured layouts with text styles and unified colors is hard. Either you start clean files from scratch, or you use what you have and try to tidy it up. The Style Inventory is meant to help you with that. It gives you an overview of all your used styles and helps you to merge styles of similar layers into one.

## Style Inventory
Generate a visual style sheet with all colors, text styles and symbols that you are using. This will help you to get an overview of your used styles so you can merge styles that are very similar.

Choose what you want to generate in the configurator. The inventory will be generated on a new page called "Style Inventory".

**Shortcut:** `ctrl` + `⌘` + `⌥` + `I`

## Name Color Swatch
If you want to organize your colors, you can name color swatches (groups) on the color inventory artboard. The plugin uses the following naming convention for palettes and colors:

Colors as part of a palette:

- `Brand > Primary`
- `Grays > 80`

A single color, not part of a palette:

- `Some Color`

You can rename the generated color swatches, or use the plugin that will show a dialog where you can enter the color name.

### Export

When you select this option in the generator, Sketch will export the Style Inventory.
